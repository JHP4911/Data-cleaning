Is data clean already??

From the initial screening , we had a look at the 4 files and following were the observation:

Dish:-The "description" column seemed to be entirely empty , we looked at some first 5000 records. The "menus_appeared" and "times_appeared" seemed to
have reported the data properly with the min value at-least equal to 1 which made sense. The "first_appeared" column seemed to have some unusual values like 1 and there were
some dishes with lowest and highest price=0.

Menu:-The "name","keyword","language","location_type" columns is entirely empty, for index between 12583-12698 no data was reported.The "sponsor" ,"venue", "places" and "event" had missing values at some places.
The "occasion" column had a lot of missing information and at many places it reported occasion as other. The "note" column had values that didn’t made much sense at many places. The "currency" and "currency_symbol"
also had a lot of data missing.


MenuItem:-"price" column had many missing information, "high price" column had mostly empty data.

MenuPage:-The data was missing for some columns , uuid had data encoded in hexadecimal format which did not prove to be of much use.There was
duplicated data.

The dataset brings with it a bunch of information which has to be both cleaned and its validity had to be determined. The data was totally un normalised 
and could have violated lot of data constraints.

Potential use case

-Data about the dishes can be used to visualise the changing food trends.
-Identify the affect of the price on the dish popularity.
-Popular dishes of all time.
-Biggest sponsor of dishes.
-Were the dishes were uses more for commercial purpose or domestic purpose.
-On what occasion did the dishes arrived
-Which menu page go the maximum dish popularity.

The dataset open a bunch of opportunity to be studied and i am sure by doing some EDA we could have achieve a much broader set of use-cases.

Data cleaning with OpenRefine


Menu:

-Checked if id column shows only unique value, the operation was performed by sorting the data and then using the blank only option of open refine which showed 0 rows affected, confirming the understanding.

-Trim whitespaces from name column -9 rows affected 
-To titlecase on name column-629 cells affected.
-Merging redundant names-961 cells affected(screenshot)

-Titlecase on sponsor column-8683 cels
-Trim spaces on sponsor-14 cells
-Cluster values sponsor -3814 cells

-Removed even , venue, place, physical_description ,occasion, keyword, language, location_type column due to missing information all blank cells.

-applied regular expression on “call_number” to return on the number and remove the “_wotm” text by return.values.split(“_”)[0]—screenshot

-Upcasted “date” column to Date datatype which caused 16959 cells to be affected and also insure that we had proper date in every cell.

-clustering on currency column which changed 216 cells.

-Casted “id”, “page_count”, “dish_count” to numeric thus ensuring that any these column only contain numerical data.

-Allied transformation on column “note” to split by “;” and get the first element using return value.split(";")[0] which changed 7076 cells.

-Apply numerical facet on id and then selected all the cells in menu which had no entry and removed them . To our surprise there were huge no of menu records where no information was there.

After all the filters and cleaning we were left with 2308 records.



Screenhsot of all transformation

MenuItem.csv

The data seemed to contain most of the information so as a part of cleaning we just applied the data type conversion by converting the “id”, “menu_page_id”, “dish_id” column to numeric and column “created_at” and “updated_at” to Date type.The type conversion helps that all the cell in the column abides by the data type and if the conversion is not possible we get a missing value at that cell.

The data seemed to contain most of the information so as a part of cleaning we just applied the data type conversion by converting the “id”, “menu_id”, “page_number”, “image_id”, “full_height”, “full_width” column to numeric .The type conversion helps that all the cell in the column abides by the data type and if the conversion is not possible we get a missing value at that cell.
