End-to-End Data Cleaning Workflow

Abstract: - Any data science or data analysis project starts by having an initial screening that lays the foundation of data engineering pipeline that starts by cleaning the data followed by feature engineering followed by feature selection and then at the last we apply some modelling techniques. Data cleaning is an integral part of this system that helps companies save a lot of time and money and helps in boosting the predictive power of a model.
  
1   Introduction
The aim of this report is to generalize the data cleaning pipeline that was followed to have an end to end workflow. We will be using the tools and the concept that we have learnt as a part of the course and apply them to the dataset.
2    Overview and initial assessment
2.1   Origin
The New York Public Libraryâ€™s menu collection, housed in the Rare Book Division, originated through the energetic efforts of Miss Frank E. Buttolph (1850-1924), who, in 1900, began to collect menus on the Library's behalf. Miss Buttolph added more than 25,000 menus to the collection, before leaving the Library in 1924. The collection has continued to grow through additional gifts of graphic, gastronomic, topical, or sociological interest, especially but not exclusively New York-related. The collection now contains approximately 45,000 items, about quarter of which have so far been digitized and made available in NTPL Digital Gallery. 
The New York Public Library is digitizing and transcribing its collections of historical menu. The collection includes about 45,000 menus from the 1840s to the present, and the goal of the digitization project is to transcribe each page of each menu, creating an enormous database of dishes, prices, locations, and so on. As of early November 2016, the transcribed database contains 1,332,279 dishes from 17,545 menus.

2.2   Structure
This dataset is split into four files to minimize the amount of redundant information contained in each (and thus, the size of each file). The four data files are Menu, Menu Page, Menu Item, and Dish. These four files are described briefly here, and in detail in their individual file descriptions below.

2.3   Content
   Menu
The core element of the dataset. Each Menu has a unique identifier and associated data, including data on the venue and/or event that the menu was created for; the location that the menu was used; the currency in use on the menu; and various other fields. Each menu is associated with some number of Menu Page values.
   Menu Page
Each Menu Page refers to the Menu it comes from, via the menu_id variable (corresponding to Menu:id). Each Menu Page also has a unique identifier of its own. Associated Menu Page data includes the page number of this Menu Page, an identifier for the scanned image of the page, and the dimensions of the page. Each Menu Page is associated with some number of MenuItem values.
   MenuItem
Each MenuItem refers to both the MenuPage it is found on -- via the menu_page_id variable -- and the Dish that it represents -- via the dish_id variable. Each MenuItem also has a unique identifier of its own. Other associated data includes the price of the item and the dates when the item was created or modified in the database.
   Dish
A Dish is a broad category that covers some number of Menu Items. Each dish has a unique id, to which it is referred by its affiliated MenuItems. Each dish also has a name, a description, several menus it appears on, and both date and price ranges.
